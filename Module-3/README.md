# Advanced API Development

Control access to your APIs, and put systems in place to ensure you maintain their health.

## Learning Objectives

- Validate and sanitize input data
- Implement search, ordering, filtering and pagination to allow client applications to get access to specific data via your APIs.
- Explain different ways to implement caching to save API infrastructure resources.
- Use token-based authentication to optimize access to your APIs for authenticated clients.
- Implement API throttling to control how often anonymous and authenticated users can access your APIs.
- Use throttling and caching to optimize and protect your API.
- Prevent users from doing anything outside of their privileges using an authorization layer.
