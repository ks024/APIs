# Django REST Framework

Use the Django REST framework to create APIs efficiently, then learn to serialize your database models and convert, validate and render data.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify the benefits of DRF over plain Django and how it can speed up API development
* Install and set up Django REST framework.
* Test APIs straight from the browser using the API view decorator.
* Use function and class-based views to create API endpoints efficiently.
* Debug your API using the debug toolbar.
* Serialize database models using different types of serializers.
* Validate input data and then map it to a model using the validation and deserialization process in DRF.
* Render API output as JSON and XML data using different types of renderers.
* Create a basic API project using DRF.
